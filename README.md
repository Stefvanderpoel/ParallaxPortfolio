This is my personal website.

# parallax
I have created a Parallax effect by using the 3d-transform css function.

# background
http://www.visual6502.org
A really nice website presenting transistor level Hardware Simulations. 
I took a screenshot of the simulation of the 6502 and used it as the background.

# initial design
I started with a bootstrap template but soon found out that it was a really tedious job to add the parallax effect. I eventually descided to keep only a few css entries and ditch the whole .js library (including jquery).
